## Data Analytics Virtual Internship

The Data Analytics Virtual Internship provides an opportunity to gain practical insight into the field of data analytics and its application at a leading company. This internship allows participants to develop career skills and valuable experience.
## Introduction

In this virtual internship, we explore the partnership between Tony Smith from KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team and Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized organization specializing in bikes and cycling accessories. Sprocket Central is interested in leveraging KPMG's expertise in analytics, information, and modeling. The project encompasses three main tasks:
## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
Evaluating data quality and completeness for analysis

Sprocket Central provided KPMG with three datasets:

   * Customer Demographic
   * Customer Addresses
   * Transactions data from the past three months

Our initial focus was on exploring the data and identifying opportunities to enhance the quality of Sprocket Central's data.
## Task 2: Data Insights
Targeting high-value customers based on demographics and attributes

To provide recommendations, we created a PowerPoint presentation outlining our approach, which included a three-week scope divided into three phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. Our detailed approach involved various activities such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, interpreting results, and reporting.
## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
Presenting insights through visualizations

We developed a Tableau dashboard to summarize the data and display the results of our analysis. Our presentation focused on addressing key business questions, including:

   * Identifying trends in the underlying data
   * Determining the customer segment with the highest value
   * Proposing marketing and growth strategies for Sprocket Central
   * Exploring external datasets that can provide deeper insights into customer preferences and purchasing behavior
